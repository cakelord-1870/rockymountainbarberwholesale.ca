<p><span>Our premium Unscented Beard Oil helps hydrate, condition and add shine to your client's beard while moisturizing the skin beneath it. Our cold-pressed, eight oil blend, helps to prevent itchiness and flaking that can come with a dehydrated face and beard.

<h6>OVERVIEW</h6>
<h4><b>Natural Ingredients to Protect &amp; Hydrate Your Client's Beard &amp; Skin</b></h4>
<p>Our premium Unscented Beard Oil blend is cold pressed and contains natural ingredients such as Grape Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil and Argan Oil. Your customers will<span> have the peace of mind knowing they're applying an all-natural beard oil to their beard as our commitment to using high quality ingredients ensures their skin and beard get the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and essential fatty acids they need to keep looking and feeling healthy.</span></p>
<p>If your client's beard is dry, their skin is just as likely to be dry and itchy. By using a beard oil regularly, they'll be able to ditch the itch - as the oil wicks down their beard and penetrates their hair follicles - keeping their skin and beard well hydrated.</p>
<h4><b>A Blank Sensory Canvas</b></h4>
<p>Our unscented beard oil provides your customers with a completely neutral, unscented base, allowing their cologne, aftershave, or body wash to do the heavy lifting. </p>
<h4><b>Bottled in Small Batches To Ensure Freshness</b></h4>
<p>Proudly crafted in small batches to ensure each and every beard oil receives the care and attention to detail your client's beard deserves. Our small batch approach means your customers receive a premium beard oil made with fresh ingredients to properly hydrate and protect their beard and face. Bottled in an amber glass bottle to ensure the integrity of the oil blend is not compromised by light.</p>

<p><span>Our premium Bamboo Beard Oil helps hydrate, condition and add shine to your client's beard while moisturizing the skin beneath it. Our cold-pressed, eight oil blend, helps to prevent itchiness and flaking that can come with a dehydrated face and beard.

<h6>OVERVIEW</h6>
<h4><b>Natural Ingredients to Protect &amp; Hydrate Your Client's Beard &amp; Skin</b></h4>
<p>Our signature<span> Bamboo</span><span> </span>Beard Oil blend is cold pressed and contains natural ingredients such as Grape Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil &amp; Argan Oil. O<span>ur commitment to using high quality ingredients ensures your client's skin and beard get the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and essential fatty acids they need to keep looking and feeling healthy.</span></p>
<p><span>If your client's beard is dry, their skin is just as likely to be dry and itchy. By using a beard oil regularly, they'll be able to ditch the itch - as the oil wicks down their beard and penetrates their hair follicles - keeping their skin and beard well hydrated.</span></p>
<h4><b>The Subtle Scent of Bamboo</b></h4>
<p><span>Not only did we want to provide a beard oil that works great, we wanted to provide your customers with beard oil that left them smelling even better. As they go about their day, the Bamboo scent of their beard will waft throughout the air, leaving behind the subtle scent of success everywhere they go.</span></p>
<h4><b>Bottled in Small Batches To Ensure Freshness</b></h4>
<p>Proudly crafted in small batches to ensure each and every beard oil receives the care and attention to detail your client's beard deserves. Our small batch approach means your customers receive a premium beard oil made with fresh ingredients to properly hydrate and protect their beard and face. Bottled in an amber glass bottle to ensure the integrity of the oil blend is not compromised by light.</p>

<h6>OVERVIEW</h6>
<h4><b>Natural Ingredients to Protect &amp; Hydrate Your Client's Beard &amp; Skin</b></h4>
<p>Our premium Unscented Beard Oil blend is cold pressed and contains natural ingredients such as Grape Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil and Argan Oil. Your customers will<span> have the peace of mind knowing they're applying an all-natural beard oil to their beard as our commitment to using high quality ingredients ensures their skin and beard get the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and essential fatty acids they need to keep looking and feeling healthy.</span></p>
<p>If your client's beard is dry, their skin is just as likely to be dry and itchy. By using a beard oil regularly, they'll be able to ditch the itch - as the oil wicks down their beard and penetrates their hair follicles - keeping their skin and beard well hydrated.</p>
<h4><b>A Blank Sensory Canvas</b></h4>
<p>Our unscented beard oil provides your customers with a completely neutral, unscented base, allowing their cologne, aftershave, or body wash to do the heavy lifting. </p>
<h4><b>Bottled in Small Batches To Ensure Freshness</b></h4>
<p>Proudly crafted in small batches to ensure each and every beard oil receives the care and attention to detail your client's beard deserves. Our small batch approach means your customers receive a premium beard oil made with fresh ingredients to properly hydrate and protect their beard and face. Bottled in an amber glass bottle to ensure the integrity of the oil blend is not compromised by light.</p>
