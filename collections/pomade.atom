<p><span>Your clients will never look as good as the moment they leave the barbershop. There's nothing worse than getting a great haircut, only to have difficulty recreating the same look day in and day out afterword. With high-shine, a firm hold, and a natural scent, our water-based Pomade will give your clients barber-grade performance at home. MSRP: $21.99.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>﻿Features: Beeswax.</strong></em></p>
<h6>OVERVIEW</h6>
<h4><b>No Grease, Washes Out Easy</b></h4>
<p>No grease stains here. Oil-based pomades can be a nightmare to wash out and can damage hair by stripping them of their natural oils, and leave your clients' forehead and scalp prone to breakouts. Our premium water-based pomade can be washed out easily, won't damage hair and won't clog pores. </p>
<h4><b>20% More Pomade, 100% More Style</b></h4>
<p>Sometimes bigger is better. To give your clients maximum style flexibility, we knew we had to provide maximum size to experiment, refine and perfect their look - that's why we set out to create one of the largest sized pomades on the market.</p>
<h4><b>Hold Hair in Place, Not Noses Hostage</b></h4>
<p>We designed this pomade to have a light natural scent, that won't come off as overpowering. So whether it's the scent of your clients' cologne, body wash or beard balm they want as their anchor scent, this pomade won't get in the way.</p>
<h4><b>Crafted in Small Batches</b></h4>
<p>Proudly created in small-batches for the ultimate craft hairstyling experience. Each step of the production process is completed in house to ensure highest quality standards throughout the process. Smaller batches mean a fresh pomade for an even fresher style.</p>
