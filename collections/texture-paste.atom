<p><span>Your clients know how important a flexible lifestyle is. A great texture paste provides a great hold while still maintaining a high level of flexibility to style and rework one's hair throughout the day. Whether your clients' hair is short, long, curly, thick or thinning, our texture paste gives them the style and confidence it takes to pull off virtually any modern hairstyle. MSRP: $17.99.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Features: Beeswax. </strong></em></p>

<h6>OVERVIEW</h6>
<h4><b>A Familiar Hold without the Clumping or Flaking</b></h4>
<p>Most guys are familiar with gels, which means they're also familiar with the clumpy feeling and flaking that they produce as well. Our texture paste, works just like hair gels and hair creams, but its plant and vegetable derived formula makes it easier to get the hair style your clients want without clumping and flaking.</p>
<h4><b>Natural Ingredients Means a Natural Style</b></h4>
<p>A natural style means being confident about how you look and feel. Our texture paste includes natural and plant derived ingredients your clients can feel good about. Featuring five natural ingredients - including Beeswax, Lanolin, &amp; Glycerin - our texture paste helps maintain a healthy hold that won't damage your customer's hair.</p>
<h4><b>Small Batch Production</b></h4>
<p>In the earliest years of manufacturing, a craftsman skillfully created goods one by one to ensure the highest level of quality. We wanted to take the same approach when designing our texture paste. Each and every product is created in-house from start to finish and inspected to ensure it meets the quality your clients expect from Rocky Mountain Barber Company.</p>
<h4><b>A Subtle Natural Scent</b></h4>
<p>Our use of natural ingredients means your customers get a texture paste that features a light, natural scent that won't come off as overpowering. Its light scent gives clients' cologne or aftershave the breathing room needed to be their feature scent.</p>
<h6>PRO-TIPS</h6>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>DIRECTIONS FOR BARBERS:</strong><span> </span>For best results, apply to your clients' hair after a cut, while it's slightly damp. Begin by using your fingertip to scoop a dime-sized amount into the palm of your other hand. Add a splash of warm water, then rub your hands together vigorously for 10 seconds to smooth the paste. Once paste is smooth, apply and work into clients' hair until fully absorbed. Style or comb as desired.<br>
